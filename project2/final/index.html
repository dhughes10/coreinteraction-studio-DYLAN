			<span id="marked">Founded and rooted in Enlightenment values</span>, the U.S. is caught between two conflicting imperatives when it comes to war achieving security through the annihilation of threats; and a <span id="marked">requirement to conduct</span> itself in a liberal and humane manner. In order to reconcile these conflicting requirements, the U.S. has often turned to scientists and laboratories to find strategies that are both <span id="marked">ecisive and humaned</span>.

		<div class="text-block two">
			This approach has <span id="marked">yielded many success</span>, but it has also resulted in some disastrous errors. In this lecture Professor Williams will <span id="marked">explore the relationship between technology</span>, law, and liberalism in America's approach to warfare and how this national style stacks <span id="marked">up against current</span> and future strategic challenges.
